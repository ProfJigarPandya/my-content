Write a program to solve sum of subsets problem.

Is Rubik's cube solution an example of backtracking?

Is Sudoku an example of backtracking?

Variations:


- Upload recursive solution of NQueen Problem (first solution)
- Upload recursive solution of NQueen Problem (all solutions)
- See if you can optimize. i.e. the symmetric solutions better be displayed without computation. 2413 -> 3142
- Solve sum of subsets (any one version; please, mention clearly your program requirements, limitations, if any)


- Arrange bishops in chessboard (Hint: You may need literally the nxn maze memory)


- Arranging white elephant

- Arrange numbers 1 to 8. Such that no sequence numbers are in neighboring positions.

- Where is the tree (Backtracking) ?

- level 1 - 4 branches

  level 2 - 3 branches

  level 3 - 2 branches

  level 1 - 1 branch

-Tree with binary 1(chosen) on left  and 0(not chose) being right
