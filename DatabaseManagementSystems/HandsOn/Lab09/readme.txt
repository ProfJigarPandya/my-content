In oracle how can we have a column applied counter value for each record automatically upon insertion? 

Sequences

Know that sequence is created but it is not attached to a specific table;

If two users are accessing the same sequence concurrently, then the sequence numbers each user receives might have gaps bacause sequence numbers are also being generated by the other user.

create sequence sequence_name;

drop sequence sequence_name;


seq_name.currval
seq_name.nextval

Once a sequence number is generated, the sequence number is available only to the session that generated the number. Independent of transactions committing or rolling back, other users referencing seq_name.NEXTVAL obtain unique values.


Can be used in insert values, few select, set caluse of update.

Can't be used
- a subquery, view, select with distinct, select with group by or order by, select combined with another select statement with the union, intersect, minus etc. , default value, check constraint.

-Do not expect that a column with oracle sequence is not attached to a table. It belongs to schema and hence can be used in insert to any table or select from dual, etc. Hence, there can be missing numbers for your table entry.


Also, explore options for creating or altering sequence

increment by 1
minvalue 1
maxvalue 500
nocache
nocycle
noorder
