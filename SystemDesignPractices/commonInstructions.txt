Ideally,
See if you can print front page, cetificates without page numbers.
Actual page numbers must start from chapter 1.
Abstract, index don't need page numbers or you may have roman numbers
i.e. I. II. III like for them. May be you need to seperate out front
page, certificate and generate pdfs. Finally, merge them back for master
pdf


Please, make sure you use correct wording to describe the scenario. Know when to use "I" and when to use "We". This apply to proeject report /presentation and answering everywhere. Be very careful and cautious. Do not rush to answer as such without really framing the phrases accurate.

Always CC your project partners


Attachment pdf shall have formatted name to help the recipient.

Make sure to practice/ may prepare videos of your presentation and use timer/stopwatch/mirrors back home to get ready.


Be prepared with project report document and presentation slides. This is the last and final priority now. No demonstration of any module/project live required. 
Make sure to share only content to us adhering to your guide Intellectual Property rights of your firm.


Know that learning is yours. Put your learning into project report best way possible. Slides should convey a story of your learning throughout past 3-4 months of internship.


Make sure to use formatting well (even distribution of text marginally, etc) and spell-grammar check.


nitially you can have everything in your report, let your supervisor cut down/ask you to remove whatever he/she does not want to be shared outside.


- Have a common order of first name and last name while mentioning team members' names. Last name better be last. Front page and certificate. You may also prefer to sort based on roll numbers ascending. 

- Name and Title

Mr. Jigar M. Pandya



- Make sure to have atleast 5 lines of space above  names in the certificate for us to be able to sign well.

- Learn etiquette of using acronyms. First usage always must be  like “Full Form (Acronym)” and later on may use acronym. Also you can have a page before introduction to provide commonly all abbreviations - titled “Abbreviations”.



- Ideally all the content must be original meaning your own. For any core content/image etc must provide source/reference.  Plagiarism is a considerable offense. Learn about IP rights (Intellectual Property)

- Use grammar and spell check tools without failure.


- Ideally the report must have all the details for anyone/yourself to follow and understand everything from A-Z.  Check on, you must not be missing any finer detail. Alternatively you may add a prerequisite page to mention them after “Abbreviations” and before Introduction.
- I personally prefer correct order (dept, fot, university) OR (university, fot, dept).
If writing on bottom of front page
dept
fot
university

If writing on top of certificate
university
fot
dept.



- Make sure all images/text are visible/readable. If not you may have chart page like print and fold within.



- Even Justify most of the report content paragraphs wherever applicable. Footer page number is must. Header can have chapter number and name or project title preferably as per department guideline.

- In the Implementation chapter, source code snippets explaining complex logics with english statements and supported screenshots, data dictionary, SQL/ORM, MVC, etc is must. IMPLEMENTATION CHAPTER MUST BE STRONG. Provide important code snippets and explain what it achieves logically.


- Test case pass/fail must have corresponding requirement id(s) column from SRS. Ideally all bugs must have been fixed and hence all cases must show "PASS".


- Make sure screenshots are readable/visible both in soft and hard copies.


- In the Miscellaneous Chapter, mention deployment steps (Software Version Deployment Document) for your project. Folder structure of the project and purpose of files, etc. 


- TEAM of 2 or more. Add a page(s) to detail work distribution/ownership of module/task performed by whom. Must perform knowledge sharing of each task to one another.

- You may have a local document with all updates. Keep reviewing it and check pdf all pages for formating/display/alignment,etc.
