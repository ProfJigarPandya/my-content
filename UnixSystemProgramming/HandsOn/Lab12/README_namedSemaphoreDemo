When I rerun it shows me error. Why?? Find bug in the program or clean up steps after the application stops.

When I rerun it shows following error. Why?? Find bug in the program or clean up steps after the application stops.

[jpandya@localhost lab7]$ ps -ef |grep a.out

 producer consumer bounded buffer using shared memory  -  START
 Error in creating named semaphores ... :  Permission denied[jpandya@localhost lab7]$ 
[jpandya@localhost lab7]$ ls -ltr

I am seeing no semaphore files are open for the current user:
[jpandya@localhost lab7]$ /usr/sbin/lsof  | grep sem
[jpandya@localhost lab7]$ 

The shared memory segment is alive, not attached though. 
ipcs
0x0000007c 4390938    jpandya   600        25600      0   


May this help:
you may use kill if there are any processes running and using the resources. Or can you add appropriate flags to reuse the semaphores and shared memory?

I am not able to find physical file location of semaphore. Any idea?
