Objectives to work on Shell Scripts Development
1)

Write a script that upon invocation shows the time and date, lists all logged-in users, and gives the
system uptime. The script then saves this information to a logfile, systemusage_mm_dd_yyyy.log format. : JMPandya


2)

Write a shell script to clean up log files. Use variables for specifying log file location, see that only root ($UID 0) shall be able to execute this script, others shall get message "Only root can execute log clean up.". :JMPandya

3)

Write a shell script to display and store to a file, 2 power n series using for loop. Here, n is entered by user. Do not use multiplication operator. In certain logic, shell script shows inappropriate result for n=63, why that happens.  correct answer examples, pow(2,62) is 611686018427387904. pow(2,63) is 9223372036854775808. You may use for ((  i = 1 ;  i <= $n;  i++  )) or for i in ` seq 1 $n`. :Sagar Sheth (CE Student)

4)

Write a shell script which reads a keyboard key and identifies the key from below categories and displays the message on the screen. "Lowercase letter", "Uppercase letter", "Digit", "Punctuation, whitespace, or other".  Hint:  [[:lower:]] identifies "Lowercase letter"   [[:upper:]]  identifies "Uppercase letter"   [0-9] identifies "Digit"   *  can identify others.  Use case statement.:JMPandya

5)

Take user's birth date as input (DD/MM/YYYY) format and show how many days, months and years he/she is of as of today(system date). You may use expr, backtick(``) and date command with format attribute to do maths.

6)

Write a shell script which takes username as input (read name only if it's not provided as command line argument) and checks out whether the user is logged in currently or not. If the user is not logged in then verify whether the user account exist or not. Display appropriate messages. Hint: use 'who -u' for logged in users and /etc/passwd file for user account.: Zeel Soni (CE Student)

7)

Using loops create following patterns

Fibonacci series:

1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

8)

Write a program to display multiplication table.


9 )

Write a shell script to find unknown x and y from two Quadratic equations a1xx+b1y+c1=0 and a2xx+b2y+c2=0. Read a1,b1,c1 and a2,b2,c2 and display x and y. You may use bc(basic calculator) to achieve intermediate results. : Toral Vyas and Kothari Urja (CE Student)

10)

write a shell script to display all factors of input number without using the command "factor". If the input is not a number, display an error message.  Please, learn that "factor" is an existing command as well which shows all factors of a number. Also, later see that if you can display uniqe factors. Also, may be prime factors.

[jpandya@JMP ~]$ factor 50
50: 2 5 5
[jpandya@JMP ~]$ factor sdf
factor: `sdf' is not a valid positive integer
[jpandya@JMP ~]$

: Padmaja Amin (CE Student)

11)

Write a shell script to download file /pub/ebooklist.txt from ftp.ddu.ac.in and display all files for java. You may use “Here Document” concept to practice. :JMPandya

12)

Write a shell script which checks the available/free space of all mount points and if there is any one occupied more than 80% then send an email to localhost/admin. Hint: df command shows disk space utilization. also, study du - disk usage.

13)

Develop a project to create student results management system. 1) New entry.. 2) Search existing student 3) Display All Records. A. Sort by FirstName. B. Sort by Last Name. C) Sort by StudentCode 4) Update a record 5) Remove a record 6) Result Analysis - How many students having distinction, first class, etc. - You may use random number generator to generate studentcode. Also, use csv file for records storing to a file.

[jpandya@JMP myBook]$ echo $RANDOM
21047
[jpandya@JMP myBook]$ echo $RANDOM
2047
[jpandya@JMP myBook]$ echo $RANDOM
5775
[jpandya@JMP myBook]$ echo $RANDOM
1354



14)

Write a function factorial and call it multiple times to find nPr - The number of permutations possible. : Wish Patel (CE Student)

15)

Write shell script to print ascii table.  (http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/c/ascii-table.html). See if you can print in "Char Dec Oct Hex" format. See scripts to print triangle pattern for a,b,c, etc in file sample_scripts_3

[jpandya@JMP shellscripts]$ echo -ne "\\0101" 65 " \c" ;echo -ne "0"`echo  "ibase=10;obase=8;65;"|bc`" \c" ; echo -n 0x; echo "ibase=10;obase=16;65"|bc
A 65  0101 0x41

16) Write a program to display following series using nested for loops. User input for rows n. i.e. n=10 then the output is as below:

1
3 5
8 11 14
18 22 26 30
35 40 45 50 55
61 67 73 79 85 91
98 105 112 119 126 133 140
148 156 164 172 180 188 196 204
213 222 231 240 249 258 267 276 285
295 305 315 325 335 345 355 365 375 385

17)

Write a shell scrip to develop CRUD (Create, read, update, delete) and Search functionality for a telephone book/directory.  : Akshay Bosamiya (CE Student)

18)

Develop a shell script to display triangular numbers series.

This sequence is generated from a pattern of dots which form a triangle.

By adding another row of dots and counting all the dots we can find the next number of the sequence:

triangular numbers

i.e for n = 9

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, ...

19)

Write a shell script to find power(m,n) without using multiplication, power like advanced functions. Hint: Use loops to achieve things. Think what is power and then think what is multiplication mathematically.

20) Develop a shell script to display following pattern:

for number of blocks 5 output as below,

1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 ...

21) Display first n odd numbers series without having '1' anywhere in that number.

i.e. for n=9, show 3 5 7 9 23 25 27 29 33

22) Write a program to display entered character is a vowel (a,e,i,o,u) or consonants (other than vowels).

23) Write a program to display first n consonants.

i.e. n=9 then B C D F G H J K L

24) Display following triangle pattern for dynamic rows:
