Simulate generating core dump files and read core dump file.

Using kill, user can send specific signal to process.


//hw.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
        printf("\n Hello World ");
        printf("\n Press any key  to exit ");
        getchar();
        return (0);
}


gcc hw.c

ulimit -c unlimited
 to set the limit of core dump file to be of unlimited size. 

[jpandya@localhost testet]$ ./a.out 

 Hello World 
 Press any key  to exit Quit (core dumped)
