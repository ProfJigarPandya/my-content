How do you like about being data detective? Are you amongst those who ask big questions first or later?


An entertainment website displays a star rating for a movie based on user reviews. Users can select from one to five whole stars to rate the movie. The star rating is an example of what type of data? 

If I may have to go back and observe how have I handled any project/module/presentation, I had always been coming up with big question/quote/agenda first to grab first best impression. And hence I am just confirming on that I am from the group of data detectives, who will ask big questions first. Being a data detective is interesting. Because it is when I am required to use my brain the most and I love doing so. One of my all-time hobbies is observing. Data detective suppose should be observing data and learn to question to come to a problem solution.
