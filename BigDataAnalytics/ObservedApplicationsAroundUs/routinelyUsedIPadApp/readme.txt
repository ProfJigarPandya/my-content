After waking up, the first time when I pick up my iPad, I open digital clock application to have digital display of clock in the center of the room to catch up with morning rush. iPad operating system has intelligently noticed my this activity as a result of Big Data Analytics/Machine Learning background processes and in the special screen compartment it helps me conveniently opening this application. This is part of User Experience. See attached screenshots.
