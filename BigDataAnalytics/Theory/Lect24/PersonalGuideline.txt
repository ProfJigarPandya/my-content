
What should you consider when deciding on the right data visualization?

Deciding on right data visualization, one should consider following:

- If number of results are 5-7 consisting 100% and wishes to showcase part-to-whole relationship than using pie charts are best.
- If data showcase a trend over period of time about a single measure then use line chart.
- If there is no noticeable difference about numbers then use table with numbers itself simply.
- When many data points are involved and having a dimension spatial that is location than utilize density maps.
- A histogram is ideal for comparing the distribution of two variables by individual grouping.
- A scatter plot is ideal for exploring potential relationships between two variables.
- Be extremely cautious when trying to mix up many concepts to convey at the same time in a single viz via color, size, shapes and labels altogether.
- Any of created viz, try to test about 5-seconds rule.
