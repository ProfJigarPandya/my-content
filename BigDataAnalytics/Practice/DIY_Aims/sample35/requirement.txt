Company has provided you collected data on their weekend sales. 

Whether the sales were online/offline or mixed? If offline also, what was the region where sales happened? 

Was there any special sale rolled out during the last weekend?

Were any difficulties faced during the sales which I should be aware of? like power outage, digital payment not working, common complaint/s by group of customer, running out of stocks on many items ahead of weekend itself, running low on staff, etc. 

Have we collected feedback in other words do we have established channels for customer to provide anonymous genuine feedback?
